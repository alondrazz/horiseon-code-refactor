# horiseon-code-refactor


## I had to make some changes in the CSS and HTMl, changing the <div> into the appropriate category. Also making the code accessible for handicap people usuing alt. And learning how to consolidate or simplify css attributes.

The code to my Github repository is- git@github.com:alondrazz/horiseon-refactor-.git
And the url is- https://github.com/alondrazz/horiseon-refactor-

- I was motivated by this because it was something new and exciting for me, there were some parts that were hard, but everytime I would figure it out, it was rewarding.
- I wanted to learn more about what I was learning because it's different watching something and doing it in groups then by doing it by myself, or with a tutor.
- A bunch of problems were solved for me because I didn't quite understand what I was learning until now, and now that I got to work with this it gave me the practice that I needed.
- I learned how to use my resorces, to not be afraid to ask for help, I also leared how to use CSS, and HTMl. I know now where to change the <divs> an d how to plug in alt. Also what can be more simplified in the CSS.

## Usage
People can use this for whenever they need to help adding alt, and if they need an example of how to consolidate, or simplify.
